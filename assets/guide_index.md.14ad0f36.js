For Quill, the bar is not just that it runs or works, it has to run or work the same way. Not only is functionality a cross platform consideration, but user and developer experience is as well. If some content produces a particular markup in Chrome on OSX, it will produce the same markup on IE. If hitting enter preserves bold format state in Firefox on Windows, it will be preserved on mobile Safari.</p><p>Quill supports all modern browsers on desktops, tablets and phones. Experience the same consistent behavior and produced HTML across platforms. <a href="https://github.com/quilljs/quill/#readme" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">See the chart</a> for more details.</p><h2 id="community"><a class="header-anchor" href="#community" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Community</h2><p>If you have questions or need help, reach out to the community at <a href="https://github.com/vueup/vueup-quill/discussions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub Discussions</a>.</p>',11);a.render=function(t,i,a,s,n,l){return e(),r("div",null,[o])};export default a;export{i as __pageData};
