For Quill, the bar is not just that it runs or works, it has to run or work the same way. Not only is functionality a cross-platform consideration, but the user and developer experience are as well. If some content produces a particular markup in Chrome on OSX, it will produce the same markup on IE. If hitting enter preserves bold format state in Firefox on Windows, it will be preserved on mobile Safari.</p><p>Quill supports all modern browsers on desktops, tablets, and phones.
