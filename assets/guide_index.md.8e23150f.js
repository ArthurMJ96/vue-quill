It was created by Jason Chen and Byron Milligan and actively maintained by <a href="https://slab.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slab</a>.</p><p>You can learn more about the rationale behind the project in the <a href="https://quilljs.com/guides/why-quill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Why Quill</a> guides.</p><h2 id="what-is-vueupquill"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-vueupquill" aria-hidden="true">#</a> What is VueUpQuill</h2><p><strong>VueUpQuill</strong> is a <strong>Plugin</strong> or <strong>Component</strong> for building rich text editors in Vue 3, this package is a thin wrapper around Quill to make it easier to use in a Vue 3 application.</p><h2 id="browser-support"><a class="header-anchor" href="#browser-support" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Browser Support</h2><p>Cross platform support is important to many Javascript libraries, but the criteria for what this means often differs. For Quill, the bar is not just that it runs or works, it has to run or work the same way. Not only is functionality a cross platform consideration, but user and developer experience is as well. If some content produces a particular markup in Chrome on OSX, it will produce the same markup on IE. If hitting enter preserves bold format state in Firefox on Windows, it will be preserved on mobile Safari.</p><p>Quill supports all modern browsers on desktops, tablets and phones. Experience the same consistent behavior and produced HTML across platforms. <a href="https://github.com/quilljs/quill/#readme" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">See the chart</a> for more details.</p><h2 id="community"><a class="header-anchor" href="#community" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Community</h2><p>If you have questions or need help, reach out to the community at <a href="https://github.com/vueup/vueup-quill/discussions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub Discussions</a>.</p>',11);i.render=function(r,a,i,s,n,l){return e(),t("div",null,[o])};export default i;export{a as __pageData};
